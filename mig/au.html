                <blockquote><b>Australia Skilled Immigration</b></blockquote>
                <p>Australia is an extremely popular destination for skilled professionals and tradespeople wishing to start a new life in another country. Australia's economy has remained strong throughout recent years, leading to a high demand for skilled
                    migrants.
                </p>

                <p>Skilled migrants wishing to work in Australia on a permanent basis are assessed on a Point Based System; with points awarded for work experience, qualifications and language proficiency. Other ways of obtaining immigration visas to Australia
                    include the Australian Family Migration, and Humanitarian Programs. Australia's Migration Program for 2015-2016 provides for up to 190,000 places, with 128,550 of those under skilled migration - such as the Australian Skilled Independent
                    Visa.
                </p>

                <p>Australia is an incredibly popular destination for skilled migrants, with over 128,500 places available in 2015-2016 under the country's General Skilled Migration (SkillSelect) program. Under the SkillSelect program skilled worker applicants
                    can gain a permanent Australia visa; using their qualifications, work experience and language ability to meet the Australian immigration requirements.</p>

                <p>The General Skilled Migration (SkillSelect) program replaced all other Australian skilled worker visas in 2012-2013. The system has 5 visa subclasses, and is points based; applicants must meet at least 60 points from the General Skilled
                    Migration (SkillSelect) points tables to be considered.

                Australia is a country and continent surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans. For about 50,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke languages classifiable
                into roughly 250 groups. After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's Eastern half was claimed by Great Britian in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South
                Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the 1850s most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. <br>On 1 January
                1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states
                and several territories. The population of 24 million is highly urbanized and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard. Its major cities are Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide. Its capital, Canberra, is inland. The country
                is known for its Sydney Opera House, the Great Barrier Reef, a vast interior desert wilderness called the Outback, and unique animal species like kangaroos and duck-billed platypuses. </div>
