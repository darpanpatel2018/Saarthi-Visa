                <p>
                    Indian students who wish to study medicine have a tremendous advantage of studying medicine at the Ukrainian Medical Universities.<b>
    </b>Consider the time, effort and cost involved in preparing for your entrance exams. At the end of it, you have a small chance of getting admission into some college in India - need not be the best colleges but it can be any college.
                    <b>
        </b>If you study in Ukraine, the only test you need to take is the Screening Test of Medical Council of India (MCI) after completing the MBBS . Passing the Screening Test enables you to get the MCI registration to practice
                    in India as a Medical practitioner. Once you are registered with MCI as a Medical Practitioner, you are in no way different from any doctor who has studied in India. In fact, your exposure to European systems and practices should give
                    you a distinct edge.<b>
                </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The screening test is fairly simple in comparison to the competitive entrance tests
        one takes in India for MBBS admission.</b></p>
                <p>
                    Anybody that has done the Medical Degree from Ukraine sincerely, can easily pass the Test.

                    <li>Your class strength is not high like in India. The doctor to student ratio will be not more than 1:10</li>

                    Europe's second largest country, Ukraine is a land of wide, fertile agricultural plains, with large pockets of heavy industry in the east.</p>
                <p>
                    While Ukraine and Russia share common historical origins, the west of the country has closer ties with its European neighbours, particularly Poland, and nationalist sentiment is strongest there.</p>

                    A significant minority of the population uses Russian as its first language, particularly in the industrialised east. In Crimea, an autonomous republic on the Black Sea that was part of Russia until 1954, ethnic Russians make up about 60% of the population.</p>

                    Russia once again seized and annexed Crimea in March 2014, amid the chaos following the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych, plunging European into its worst diplomatic crisis since the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    In 1932-1933, Stalin's programme of enforced agricultural collectivisation brought famine and death to millions in Ukraine, the bread basket of the USSR. Not until its twilight years did the Soviet Union acknowledge the extent of the suffering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    News of another Soviet-era calamity, the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, rang alarm bells around the world immediately. About 8% of Ukraine's territory was contaminated as were large areas in neighbouring Belarus. Millions have suffered
                    as a result.</p>
                <p>
                    <b class="black">Independence</b></p>
                <p>
                    The first president after independence, former Communist Party leader Leonid Kravchuk, presided over rapid economic decline and runaway inflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His successor, Leonid Kuchma, oversaw a steady economic recovery, but was accused by the opposition of conceding too much to Russian economic interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This opposition to Mr Kuchma grew, further fed by discontent at media censorship, manipulation of the political system and cronyism.</p>
                <p>
                    The authorities' attempt to rig the 2004 presidential elections led to the "Orange Revolution", with reference to the colour of the main opposition movement.

                    <b>Europe or Russia?</b></p>
                <p>
                    Mass protests, a revolt by state media against government controls and the fracturing of the governing coalition brought in European-Union mediation and a re-run of the election.</p>
                <p>
                    The euphoria of the Orange Revolution protesters gave way to disappointment as its leaders squabbled once in power</p>
                <p>
                    A fragile alliance of anti-Kuchma forces united behind pro-Western former prime minister Viktor Yushchenko, who won the presidency.</p>
                <p>
                    Mr Yushchenko succeeded in carrying out some democratic reform, but moves towards Nato and EU membership were slowed by divided public opinion in Ukraine and Western reluctance to antagonise a resurgent Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    Rivalry with his prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, soured into open antagonism, and neither proved able to cope with the worldwide economic downturn after 2008.

                    Their opponent in the Orange Revolution, Viktor Yanukovych, won the 2010 presidential election. He swiftly re-oriented foreign and trade policy towards Russia, clamped down on media freedom, and had various opponents, most prominently Ms Tymoshenko, imprisoned
                    in politically-motivated trials.</p>
                <p>
                    Although trade with EU countries now exceeds that with Russia, Moscow is the largest individual trading partner. Ukraine depends on Russia for its gas supplies and forms an important part of the pipeline transit route for Russian gas exports to Europe.</p>
