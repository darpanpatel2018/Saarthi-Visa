                 of studying in Malaysia? You’re not alone.
                                                                        According to 
                UNESCO, Malaysia is the 12th most popular education destination for
                                                                        international

                                <p>
                                    The process of applying to enter Malaysia as a student is simple. There are about 110,000 international students from more than 100 countries studying in Malaysia – testimony that Malaysia is a popular choice for international students.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you are considering becoming an international student in Malaysia, you may be wondering where to begin in applying to study in this country. The chart below outlines the steps involved in preparing you to become an international student in Malaysia.
                                    There is no centralised system for international student application. This means that prospective students need to apply directly to the institutions they are considering.

                                    There are over 500 private higher educational institutions in Malaysia but only about <b>200 of these institutions approved</b>by the Ministry of Home Affairs to recruit international students. In contrast, all public
                                    universities are allowed to recruit international students. Do make sure that the institution you’re applying to is authorised to enrol international students.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Students are advised to consult the student counsellors or relevant representatives of the institution on the type of programmes offered and its entry requirements. Also, find the budget that best fits your needs. Malaysian institutions offer many options
                                    that will meet most students’ requirements. Assistance in the application of a Student Pass and Visa to enter Malaysia is usually provided by the institution at which the student is enrolled. The immigration procedure
                                    is fairly simple.</p>

                                    If you have the chance, visiting Malaysia to check out the institutions you have shortlisted will help you make a better decision when choosing which college or university at which to enrol. You can also get more information by searching our Institution

        of industrial growth and political stability.</b></p>
                                <p>
                                    Its multi-ethnic, multi-religious society encompasses a majority Muslim population in most of its states and an economically-powerful Chinese community. Consisting of two regions separated by some 640 miles of the South China Sea, Malaysia is a federation
                                    of 13 states and three federal territories.</p>
                                <p>
                                    It is one of the region's key tourist destinations, offering excellent beaches and brilliant scenery. Dense rainforests in the eastern states of Sarawak and Sabah, on the island of Borneo, are a refuge for wildlife and tribal traditions.

                                    Ethnic Malays comprise some 60% of the population. Chinese constitute around 26%; Indians and indigenous peoples make up the rest. The communities coexist in relative harmony, although there is little racial interaction - and the overturning of a ban
                                    on the use of the word "Allah" by non-Muslims in December 2009 highlighted the religious divide in the country.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Although since 1971 Malays have benefited from positive discrimination in business, education and the civil service, ethnic Chinese continue to hold economic power and are the wealthiest community. The Malays remain the dominant group in politics while
                                    the Indians are among the poorest.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The country is among the world's biggest producers of computer disk drives, palm oil, rubber and timber. It has a state-controlled car maker, Proton, and tourism has considerable room for expansion.</p>
                                <p>
                                    indigenous Penan people of Sarawak have been affected by large-scale logging</p>
                                <p>
                                    Malaysia's economic prospects have been dented by the global economic downturn, which has hit export markets hard. In March 2009 the government unveiled a $16bn economic stimulus plan as it sought to stave off a deep recession.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Concerns have been raised that the drive towards further industrialisation could pose a serious threat to the environment. The Borneo rainforest is under pressure from palm oil plantations, and environmental campaigners have expressed misgivings over
                                    wholesale logging in the state of Sarawak.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Environmental activists have also objected to plans for a rare earths processing plant in the state of Pahang.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The country also faces the challenge of sustaining stability in the face of religious differences and the ethnic wealth gap.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Malaysia's human rights record has come in for international criticism. Internal security laws allow suspects to be detained without charge or trial.
